# ProjectView
Project management tool

A Java Swing desktop project management tool.  Written because MS Project never seems to work effectively for software projects.  This is written as a client server application - the key data is stored in a RDBMS.  This makes it easier to keep a central repository and to make it accessible to stakeholders.

## Other features:
* This models undertainty in estimates and allows monte-carlo analysis of the project to give a probability vs time graph of project completion. 
* Keeps task history.  So is your project late because of poor estimates, scope creep, low burn rate or what?  Your project is early?  Really???
* Effort driven levelling to help assign resources to tasks
* Critical path analysis
